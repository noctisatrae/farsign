# farsign - a package for easy sign-in with Farcaster
![banner](https://github.com/noctisatrae/farsign/blob/master/assets/banner.jpeg?raw=true)

## What is it used for?
This monorepo contains two packages: `@farsign/hooks` and `@farsign/utils` - the first can be used within any React app to easily implement sign-in with Farcaster and get all the information you need on the signed-in user; the second package contains the basic logic of the authentification that you can use to build your own package to be used with your favorite framework! We're open to PRs and would be very excited to see your work if you implemented something like that :D !

## Features
- [X] private key stored in localStorage
- [X] react hooks for easy implementation in your app
